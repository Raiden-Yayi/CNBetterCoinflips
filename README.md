- The plugin will prevent the spawns of a specified amount of coins around the map.
- The plugin will replace a specified amount of the chosen item (by default SCP-500) with a coin in the SCP pedestals.
- The plugin will assign a random amount of uses to every thrown coin. This amount can be read or set with a command. If a coin runs out of uses it breaks.

# Commands

- GetSerial - gets the serial number of an item held by you or another player.
- CoinUses - gets or sets the number of uses a specific coin has. Example usage: `coinuses get player 5`, `coin uses set player 4`, `coinuses set serial 10` 

# Permissions

- bc.coinuses.get - grants access to the CoinUses Get command
